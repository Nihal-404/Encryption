# Encryption

### Hello there, 
This is just a self project I did. I just created kind of new type of encryption method for no reason. This method can encrypt any type of text input you give from your keyboard. And also can decrypt them into text. I don't actually know what to call it. So, for now I am calling it 'Tinary' .

## Tinary rules
A Tinary data is kinda similar to a binary data. but comes with some difference. In binary you will find 8 numbers. but in Tinary there is only 5. Binary uses 0, 1 and space. But Tinary uses 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. The main numbers are just 0, 1, 2 and 3. 4 Just seperates every data. So lets see how Tinary data is encrypted or decrypted. 

## Encryption
lets say we want to convert 'Tinary' into Tinary code. 
So for this we will have to know the number of every characters. In this condition, T = 29 , i = 44, n = 49, a = 36, r = 53, y = 60. Just like This every character got a specific number. Now 29 can be encrypted in one way of binary. but can be encrypted in many different way in Tinary. like 03021 or 11021 or 11101. The program will give you 03021. things are kinda same as binary. so value of first number from right is 1 secound number is 2 third is 4 fourth is 8 and fifth is 16. then we will see which number is there. we will multiply the value with the number and add them all. so 03021 = (0 * 16) + (3 * 8) + (0 * 4) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 29. Just like this i = 44 = 20300. but if we want to write Ti then it won't be 0302120300. It will be like 03021420300. There will be a 4 to seperate T and i. so final encrypted version of 'Tinary' is 03021420300430001420020430021430300. Decryption got the same rule. get value of Tinary code then convert them to characters
